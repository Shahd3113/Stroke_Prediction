# Stroke Prediction Project

**Course:** Math of Data Science  
**Supervised by:** Dr. Ahmed Antar & Eng. Salma  

This project aims to predict stroke occurrences using machine learning techniques. It includes:

- Data preprocessing & advanced handling of imbalanced classes
- Statistical analysis (Chi-square, T-test, ANOVA)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA, SVD)
- Modeling: KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Network
- Model evaluation and comparison across multiple data versions

**Key Result:** Neural Network on Balanced Original Features achieved highest accuracy (~94.4%) with excellent generalization.
